# Sorting-Algorithms-Data-Structures-in-Python-
Here we simply look at, and implement some sorting algorithms including Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Quick Sort and Heap Sort. We also write libraries for Data Structures such as Binary Tree, Hash Table, Stack, Queue,  and Linked Lists.

For each of the Sorting Algorithms, we start of with a quick description of how they work, just for understanding. We then proceed to define a function for each, implementing the described method, and ensuring the function works as intended. We also go over the runtime complexity in big O notation for each algorithm. 

We then take a whistlestop tour of the basic datastructures in python, e.g. lists, dictionaries, tuples, sets, strings and arrays. Then, we take a more in depth look at the more complex data structures. We write libraries for Binary Trees, Hash Tables, Stacks, Queues, and Linked Lists, which contain all the appropriate methods per structure. We then implement the defined classes, and give a quick tour of the runtime complexity of each.

    "Quicksort is a highly efficient sorting algorithm that works by partitioning an array into two sub-arrays, then recursively sorting each sub-array. It follows the divide-and-conquer strategy. The key idea behind quicksort is to select a 'pivot' element from the array and partition the other elements into two sub-arrays according to whether they are less than or greater than the pivot. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a step-by-step explanation of the Quicksort algorithm:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Choose a Pivot:** Select a pivot element from the array. This pivot can be chosen in various ways, such as selecting the first element, the last element, a random element, or even the median of the array.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Partitioning:** Rearrange the elements in the array so that all elements less than the pivot come before it, and all elements greater than the pivot come after it. After this partitioning, the pivot is in its final sorted position.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Recursively Sort Sub-arrays:** Recursively apply the above steps to the sub-arrays formed by partitioning the array at the pivot. That is, apply Quicksort to the sub-array of elements less than the pivot and the sub-array of elements greater than the pivot.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Combine:** Once all the recursive calls have completed, the entire array will be sorted.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Base Case:** The base case for the recursion is when the sub-array has zero or one element, in which case it is already considered sorted.\n",
    "\n",
    "Quicksort has an average and best-case time complexity of $O(n.log(n))$, where n is the number of elements in the array. However, in the worst case (when the pivot is poorly chosen, leading to highly unbalanced partitions), the time complexity can degrade to $O(n^2)$. Despite this worst-case scenario, Quicksort is often faster in practice compared to other $O(n.log(n))$ sorting algorithms like Merge Sort and Heap Sort, especially for large datasets, due to its cache efficiency and low overhead."

    "Here's a brief overview of how heap sort works:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Heapify the array:** First, the input array is converted into a binary heap. This is done by repeatedly calling a function called \"heapify\" on the array, starting from the last non-leaf node and moving upwards towards the root. This ensures that each subtree of the array satisfies the heap property, where the parent node is greater (for max-heap) or smaller (for min-heap) than its children.\n",

    "2. **Extract elements from the heap:** After heapifying the array, the largest (for max-heap) or smallest (for min-heap) element is always at the root of the heap. We repeatedly remove this element from the root and swap it with the last element of the heap (which is then considered part of the sorted array). This operation \"extracts\" elements from the heap in sorted order.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Heapify again:** After removing an element from the heap, the remaining elements may no longer satisfy the heap property. To restore the heap property, we call the heapify operation again on the reduced heap, excluding the sorted elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Repeat: Steps 2 and 3 are repeated until the heap is empty, and all elements have been extracted and placed in their correct positions in the sorted array.\n",

    "Data structures in Python are fundamental components that allow you to organize, store, and manipulate data efficiently. Python provides a rich set of built-in data structures as well as modules and libraries for more specialized data structures. Here's a brief introduction to some commonly used data structures in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Lists:**\n",
    " - Lists are ordered collections of items that can hold elements of different data types. They are mutable, meaning you can change, add, and remove elements after the list is created. Lists are versatile and widely used for storing sequences of items.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Tuples:**\n",
    " - Tuples are similar to lists but are immutable, meaning their elements cannot be modified after creation. They are often used to represent fixed collections of items, such as coordinates or records. Tuples are also faster and more memory-efficient than lists.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Dictionaries:**\n",
    " - Dictionaries are unordered collections of key-value pairs. They provide fast lookups by key and are commonly used for mapping unique keys to values. Dictionaries are flexible and can store heterogeneous data types as both keys and values.\n",
    "   \n",
    "4. **Sets:**\n",
    " - Sets are unordered collections of unique elements. They are useful for eliminating duplicates and performing set operations like union, intersection, and difference. Sets are implemented using hash tables, making membership tests and set operations very efficient.\n",
    "   \n",
    "5. **Strings:**\n",
    " - Strings are immutable sequences of characters. They are used to represent text data and support various string manipulation operations, such as slicing, concatenation, and formatting.\n",
    "   \n",
    "6. **Arrays:**\n",
    " - Arrays are homogeneous collections of items with a fixed size. They are implemented by the array module and are useful for numerical computations and efficient memory usage."

    "A stack is a data structure that follows the Last-In, First-Out (LIFO) principle, where the last element added is the first one removed. Key points about stacks include:\n",
    "\n",
    " - **Operations:** Stacks support two main operations:\n",
    " - - **Push:** Adds an element to the top of the stack.\n",
    " - - **Pop:** Removes and returns the top element of the stack.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    " - **Implementation:** Stacks can be implemented using arrays or linked lists. Arrays offer constant-time access but may require resizing, while linked lists provide dynamic memory allocation and efficient insertion/deletion.\n",
    "\n",
    " - **Applications:** Stacks are used in various algorithms and applications, including function call management (like we had mentioned above in the recursive function call in Mergesort), expression evaluation, undo mechanisms, and backtracking algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    " - **Time Complexity:** Stack operations typically have a time complexity of O(1) (constant time) for both push and pop operations.\n",
    "\n",
    " - **Stack Memory:** In computer memory management, a stack is a region of memory used to store data temporarily during program execution, such as function call information.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, stacks are versatile data structures with efficient operations and find wide use in computer science and programming for managing function calls, evaluating expressions, and implementing various algorithms. See below where we implement a Stack Class using Lists! You can take a look inside the module itself, in the Stack.py file included within this directory. "

    "Linked lists are a fundamental data structure in computer science used for storing and managing collections of elements. Unlike arrays, which store elements in contiguous memory locations, linked lists store elements in nodes where each node contains a reference (or pointer) to the next node in the sequence. Here are the key components and concepts of linked lists:\n",
    "<br> \n",
    " - **Node:** A node is the basic building block of a linked list. Each node contains two fields:\n",
    "<br> \n",
    " - - **Data:** This field stores the actual element or data that the node holds.\n",
    "<br> \n",
    " - - **Next:** This field is a reference (or pointer) to the next node in the sequence.\n",

    " - **Tail:** In some implementations, the tail of the linked list is a reference to the last node in the sequence. It can be useful for efficiently adding elements to the end of the list.\n",

    " - **Singly Linked List:** In a singly linked list, each node contains only one reference to the next node in the sequence. Traversal in a singly linked list can only be done in one direction, starting from the head and proceeding through each subsequent node until the end of the list is reached.\n",
